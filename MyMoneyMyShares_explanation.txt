**My Money My Shares

This question only involves the understanding of programming language and Maths concept so I have not used Google for solving it.

In this problem firstly I have taken inputs as per the given instruction then calculated the shares of each one,
As we have to divide Apples by weight so I have calculated the exact weight which will be given to each one corresponding to there money share.
Eg: total_amount_paid =100;
	ram_paid=50,sham_paid=30,rahim_paid=20;
	shares = (100/50),(100/30),(100/20);
	then get the corresponding weight;
