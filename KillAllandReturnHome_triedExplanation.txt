**Kill All and Return Home

firstly I have observed it as a Matrix which has some boxes marked and we have given(1,2) as HOME from here we have to start and come back to it after going through some of other nodes.

I have thought to make picking and not picking for kill choice for every node unless the node is at extreme and if the node is not picked for killing this time then it will be killed next time and it will produce another path.

RESULT : 
	I have thought of doing it like subsequence problem like visiting node and taking them for either JUM or KILL and marking for JUMP to pop(KILL) next time.
but during writing code I face to issue to categorize the nodes at extreme, I thought of saving the visited and going ahead if size is reached then consider visited one as extreme and marking it for KILL.
